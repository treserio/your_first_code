        <h2>Why doesn't he go by Frank?</h2>
        <h3>Why does he want to become a programmer?</h3>
        <h3>These are all excellent questions, lets dive right in!</h3>
        <p>Born Frank A. Serio III it became pretty obvious right off the bat that calling everyone Frank wasn’t going to work. Tres was decided as my name from uno, dos, tres, although why Italian numbers weren’t chosen uno, due, tre I cannot say!</p>
        <p>I’ve always been a gamer since Atari and the first Nintendo. I was hooked, my dad was always interested in new technologies and would play some with me when I was a kid. Eventually, I got into computer gaming, Kings Quest, Battle Chess, Privateer, X-Wing these were some of the games I loved growing up. With WarCraft, StarCraft, Quake, and various other multiplayer games I became interested in networking. Which more or less led to a career in IT, although less on the infrastructure side and more in general help desk, unfortunately.</p>
        <p>Supporting users across multiple applications has helped me understand a few things about UI design and given me perspective on the impact of certain design choices. I began to think about how I would implement my own choices and started building tools for various jobs as a way to assist my team in completing their tasks. For instance, I’ve tied Outlook into an Access DB to send out follow-up emails to hundreds of customers in a matter of minutes when it would take a team of 4 half a day’s work.</p>
        <p>However, the transition hasn’t been very easy, just getting the opportunity from a company to program without a 4-year degree has been difficult. So I work on projects, continue to take courses on <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a>, and now I’m hoping that Holberton is just the kick start my career needs to prove I can solve problems that challenge even the most seasoned programmer.</p>
