        <p>So growing up my parents split and my father lived overseas in <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/m9nf8z9DT7ihDmeMA" target="_blank">Shekou China</a>. This was about the time that I was 10. Because of this my sister and I started going over to stay with him for the summers. I never realized at the time just how significant this was. Spending months overseas as a kid is an opportunity I never fully realized the value of until later on in life. One of the things the experience exposed me to was Anime. It was nothing like the comics back home, there were intense fights, blood, and people dying. It totally blew me away.</p>
        <img src="images/Krillin.png" class="smallR">
        <p>All the english speaking families that the oil company brought over lived in a small community of houses, and they were all into this Dragon Ball Z anime. Playing around the house firing off <a href="https://dragonball.fandom.com/wiki/Kamehameha" target="_blank">Kamehamehas</a> at each other and role playing as their favorite characters. One of the kids had the entire series of graphic novels, and I remember the covers forming a picture when they were all stacked together. I just thought it was so cool, it was either in the original japanese or korean, I can’t remember, but I know I couldn’t read it. Still I just made up my own stories to go along with the images as I “read” through the entire thing.</p>
        <p>Anime is really growing in popularity and beginning to overshadow the US comic market. WIth the incredible commercial success of “Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba the Movie: Mugen Train”, god that’s a long title, we may see more and more of these movies in theaters and not just for a limited run. One can only hope.</p>
        <p>Here's a cool mashup video that gets me pumped every time I see it:</p>
